# For CTOs: AI-Native Engineering Pilot (4 Weeks)

## ❗ The Problem

AI tools (Copilot, Cursor, Claude) increase development velocity…

…but many teams are now seeing:

- race conditions in frontend / real-time flows  
- regressions after “small” changes  
- architectural drift from AI-generated code  
- unstable releases and hard-to-reproduce incidents  

> **You’re shipping faster than ever, but you trust the code less than ever.**

---

## 🎯 What I Do

I run a **4-week AI-Native Pilot** where we fix **one** high-impact engineering problem caused or amplified by AI-generated code.

Examples:

- Race conditions in React / R3F / WebGL  
- Broken opening sequences or timing issues  
- Nondeterministic rendering or state transitions  
- Async/event-ordering bugs  
- Performance cliffs after AI-assisted refactors  

You pick the problem.  
I fix it and leave you with patterns your team can reuse.

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Methodology)

The pilot applies deterministic patterns proven in the **MetaCurtis Engine v3.1**:

- **Pattern S — Single Writer Governance**  
- **Pattern D — Deterministic Directives**  
- **Pattern C — Contracts & Evidence**  
- **Pattern E — Eventguard Ordering**  
- **Kodex–Claude Protocol v3.0** (10–15× feature velocity)  

These patterns turn AI-generated code from *chaotic* to *predictable*.

## 📦 What You Get in 4 Weeks

- ✅ One critical issue fixed in your codebase  
- ✅ Deterministic pattern integrated (single-writer, directives, contracts, etc.)  
- ✅ Short internal doc explaining the issue, fix, and pattern  
- ✅ Before/after evidence (instrumentation or logs)  
- ✅ A handoff call with actionable recommendations  

---

## 💰 Pricing

- **Pilot:** $15,000 (fixed fee), ~4 weeks  
- Optional follow-on:  
  - 3-month advisory / implementation retainer  
  - Broader pattern rollout / architecture hardening  

---

## 🤝 Who This Is For

- Teams already using AI tools heavily in development  
- Engineering orgs with complex UIs, 3D/graphics, dashboards, or real-time systems  
- Leaders who want AI speed **without** sacrificing architectural integrity
